                    <p>Before you can practice something new, whether it is learning to juggle or forming a cutting-edge marketing strategy, you must first know yourself. 
                        Setting underlying goals and motivations in your mind allows you to act with purpose (even if you happen to drop the ball.)</p>

                                    In a fixed mindset, people believe their qualities are fixed traits and therefore cannot change. These people document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. They also believe that talent alone leads to success, and effort is not required. 
                                    People with a fixed mindset tend to spend a lot of their time and effort to prove their worth and intelligence because they believe that they have a set amount.
